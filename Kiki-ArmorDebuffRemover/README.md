This mod allows you to set the mouse penalty of armor, rigs or helmets to 0.
As well as being able to remove the movement speed, or ergonomic penalty from armors.
Set the options you want enabled to true in config.json.
Thanks to X.Fight for the suggestion, and as always to Ereshkigal for the mod framework.
