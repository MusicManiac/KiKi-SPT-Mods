Removes degradation from all repairs.
config option "qualityMultiplier" smaller is more total repaired, is a multiplier. (1 is default, 0 is no degradation, 0.5 half, 2 double etc.)credit to @Cypher for the idea for this option.
Config option "repairPriceMultiplier" to increase repair prices, is a multiplier 1 is cheapest (Prapor default), it does seem hard to get spread here, will research further credit to @lord_of_wolfgirls for the request
If qualityMultiplier is 0 repairPriceMultiplier does not seem to function (can set to 0.1 to aleviate, but I need to find a beter method).
Of note, there will still be some degredation when using repair kits, due to skill level.
