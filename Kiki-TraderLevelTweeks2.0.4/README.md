  I made this mod to complement a hardcore, no selling to traders, play-through that i have been enjoying alongside andrudis-questmaniac ( https://mods.sp-tarkov.com/files/file/160-andrudis-questmaniac/ ).
  The issue I wished to address was to remove the minimum sales value for trader level ups (as i am not selling to them, and have little money it was unlikely I could level them in a timely manner).
    I am however a believer of modularity and have included the option to toggle off the minimum sales sum, standing, and level independently, as well as an option to make traders uninterested in buying your junk!
	All are toggle-able in config.JSON
	WARNINGS!!
	When you meet the level up requirements, you will need to buy one item from the trader to refresh their inventory / level.
	If you change a requirement to being below what has been unlocked, the inventory will show incorrectly in the trader and the requirements will not show in the top right.  To fix this, buy an item from the trader, and restart your game + server.
