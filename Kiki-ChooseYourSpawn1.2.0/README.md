***Instructions***
This will allow you to disable player spawn points of your choosing.
First you must set the config to enable the map.
Please refer to the included maps, spawns are numbered. To disable a spawn, set the corresponding number under the map name in the config to false.
For example if you only want to spawn next to the power plant in interchange, you would set all the numbers apart from 7 to false under interchange.
If debug is enabled in the config, it will print handy information to the server log.

***Disclaimers***
The spawns are in groups of 5. (other than labs)

Using mods that add custom player spawn points will not work (unless you add them in groups of five, and adjust the config accordingly)

Spawn points on maps are not going to be in the exact location, but should give a rough idea of where the spawn should be.

It is very likely that some of the spawns are the wrong way round (number wise on the map). I will start a comment thread on the mod website, please let me know if you find anything out of place (ie the map and number that are incorrect) and I will make an update pass in a little time.


Hook me upif anyone has the time and knowledge to put together a config .exe.

***Thanks***

Shout out to everyone who has helped along the way, with especial thanks to Fin for saving me hours of headaches, and @Kiubu, who not only found the bug that I had spent two days bashing my head against the wall to figure out, but also refactored my code which taught me a couple of trick.

Thanks to @CWX for the new and improved maps.
